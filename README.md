# Workflow Documentation

{% hint style="info" %}
**Test and feedback**

This documentation is currently only available through a direct link as we want to ensure a proper test phase before publishing the documentation publicly.

The plan is to launch the Workflow documentation with the release of Umbraco Workflow on December 7th, 2022.

**Do you have feedback on the documentation?** Please send it to [docs@umbraco.com](mailto:docs@umbraco.com) or create an [Issue on the GitHub repository](https://github.com/umbraco/UmbracoDocs/issues).
